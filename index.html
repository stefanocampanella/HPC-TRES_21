					<h3>Template-matching in computer vision</h3>
					<p>
						Template matching (TM) is a technique originally developed in digital image processing to find the part of an image that <em>resemble</em> a given template.
					</p>
					<p class=fragment>
						In its simplest version, the idea is to compute a similarity index as the template moves across the image. If some criterion based on the index is met, there is a match.
					</p>
				</section>

				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>A TM algorithm example</h3>
					<p>A straightforward choice for measuring similarity is the so-called normalized cross-correlation \(r\) (Pearson correlation index). Consider the case of a <b>1D</b> image \(x_n\) and of a search for a <b>single occurrence</b> of template \(y_n\):</p>
					<div class="r-frame fragment", data-fragment-index="1", style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
						<div style="width: 80%; text-align: left; font-family: var(--r-code-font);">
							<p class=fragment data-fragment-index="1"> 
								Inputs ← \( (x_n)_{0 \leq n < M}, (y_n)_{0 \leq n < N} \) where \( M > N\).
							</p>
							<p class=fragment>
								For \(k = 0, \ldots, M - N\) compute \(r_k\), where 
								\[ 
									r_k = \frac{\sum\limits^N_{n = 0} ( x_n - \langle x \rangle ) ( y^{(k)}_n - \langle y^{(k)}\rangle )}{\left( \sum\limits^N_{n = 0} ( x_n - \langle x \rangle )^2 \sum\limits^N_{n = 0} ( y^{(k)}_n - \langle y^{(k)} \rangle )^2 \right)^\frac{1}{2}} \; ,
								\]
								and \(y^{(k)}_n = y_{k + n}\).
							</p>
							<p class=fragment>
								Output ← detection at \(\text{argmax} \left( r_k \right)\).

					<h3>Earthquake template-matching (EQTM)</h3>
					<p>
						The previous one dimensional case is the one of seismology, with one important difference: both the signal and the template comprise <b>several time series</b> (traces). Simplifying a bit, <b>each trace is a seismogram registered at a particular location</b>.
					</p>
					<p class=fragment>
						Here, the <b>template</b> is the relevant part of the signal produced by a <b>known earthquake</b> (i.e. coming from an existing catalogue) at that location. The similarity index is usually the mean value of the ones of each trace. If there is a match, one might reasonably conclude that it has approximately the <b>same source</b> as the template.
					</p>
					<p class=fragment>
						Indeed, the <b>relative displacement of traces</b> in the template (delays) encodes important information about the <b>position of the source</b> and the value of the similarity index encompasses both the similarity of waveforms and delays.
					</p>

					<h3>Scientific goal</h3>
					<p>
						This technique has been applied to the study (RISE, Horizon 2020) of the central Italy normal fault, in particular to the pre-sequence of the Amatrice earthquake (August 24th, 2016).
					</p>
					<p>
						The relevance of such studies concernes:
						<ol>
							<li>Production of augmented catalogues for statistical purposes.</li>
							<li>Analysis of seismogenic processes.</li>

					<h3 class="r-fit-text">The whole analysis in plain language</h3>
					<p class="r-fit-text">Find all the matches in the data for each template and store the detections on disk.</p>

					<h3>The workload in numbers</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>48,000 templates, 5 seconds each</li>
						<li>3,600 days of continuous data recorded at 20Hz</li>
						<li>Up to 18 traces used for TM</li>
						<li>Previous TM performance ≈ 0.05 second / trace template day</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Previous version of the software used for EQTM was <b>infeasible for analyses of this size</b> and would have required <b>order of 200,000,000 core hours</b>.
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>First optimizations</h3>
					<p>
						The problem is <b>embarassingly parallel and CPU-bounded</b>. The computation for one pair (template, day) is independent from the others and the largest fraction of time is spent in the <b>calculation of the cross-correlation</b>, which is \(\mathcal{O}(n^2)\). Thus first round of optimizations was concerned with serial code.
					</p>
					<p class=fragment>
						Avoiding useless IO accounted for most of the optimizations of this first step. Also error handling had a role (if a bug makes the code fail after 0.01 second one time in ten, you have wasted 4,000,000 core hours).
					</p>
					<p class=fragment>
						However, analizing each pair separately would scale the IO as well. Workload orchestration needs to take IO/computation overlap (if available) into account. 
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Workload orchestration</h3>
						<p class=fragment>One process per day, processing all templates (more or less) using a thread pool.</p>

					<h3>Why is Python used in scientific computing?</h3>
					<p>
						Python is utterly slow. Then why is it used in numerical crunching?
					</p>
					<p>
						The answer is that, most of the time, scientific codes are not running Python at all. Usually, in these codes, the distribution of the execution time spent on each line is sharply peaked around a couple of routines. The open-source community then rewritten them in a programming language with less overhead.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hence, to get acceptable performance, you need to work with arrays (indexable objects of continuous memory) and avoid tight loops. This style of programming is called array programming.
